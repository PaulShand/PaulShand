# Paul Shand's Project Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm Paul Shand, a recent college graduate with a passion for exploring various facets of computer science and engineering. This repository is a collection of key projects I've worked on, demonstrating my skills in areas ranging from multithreading and cache mechanisms to logic design and compiler construction. Each project represents a piece of my journey through academic and personal exploration in the field of computer engineering.

## Projects Overview

### [Multi-Threaded Queue Editing and Object Locking](https://github.com/PaulShand/Multi-Thread)
This project explores the intricacies of multithreading in C. It includes the implementation of a custom reader-writer lock and a thread-safe queue, both utilizing pthreads for concurrency management.

### [Logic Design Projects - Verilog Code](https://github.com/PaulShand/Intro-Logic-Design)
A collection of projects completed in my Introduction to Logic Design course, showcasing my skills in Verilog. The projects range from basic digital logic gates to complex designs like an interactive reflex game, all developed using Vivado and programmed onto a Basys 3 FPGA board.

### [Embedded System Design Course - Labs](https://github.com/PaulShand/Course-Embedded-System-Design)
Hands-on labs from my Embedded System Design course, focusing on using the PSoC 6 CY8CPROTO-063-BLE Prototyping Kit and Arduino Nano 33 BLE. These labs cover a range of topics, from basic microcontroller programming to complex systems involving communication protocols and external hardware integration.

### [Intro-Compiler Project](https://github.com/PaulShand/Intro-Compiler)
An exploration into compiler design, this project delves into tokenization, parsing, AST construction, and Local Value Numbering (LVN). Written in Python, this compiler compiles a simplified version of the C language into assembly language instructions.

### [Cacher.c - Cache Implementation](https://github.com/PaulShand/Cache)
An implementation of cache mechanisms in C, featuring FIFO, LRU, and Clock designs. The project uses doubly linked lists to simulate caching behavior and provides valuable insights into different caching algorithms and their applications.

### [Cube-Computer](https://github.com/PaulShand/Cubeputer)
Cube-Computer is a digital logic design project using Logisim to simulate a custom-built computer system. It includes a unique processor and GPU that manipulate a cube on a 2D display using a custom instruction set. Features include schematic design, interactive controls, and real-time cube manipulation commands.

### [Sumplete-Solver](https://github.com/PaulShand/Sumplete-Solver)
An advanced strategy employing constraint satisfaction techniques to efficiently solve Sumplete puzzles at the highest difficulty levels in under 3 seconds. This project uses selenium.webdriver to automate puzzle solving in a web browser, with options for different solving strategies and puzzle sizes.
